⚠️ Work In Progress
This project is currently under active development and is not yet complete.
Expect bugs, missing features, and unpolished UI while construction is underway.

## **Description**

**Lattice** s a full-stack social networking application designed for mycologists, researchers, and explorers of thought. Built with TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, and React, the platform allows users to register, share "Thoughts," react to others, and build connections through a friend system.

This app is still in progress and is being developed as part of an educational project. While many core backend and UI components are functioning, the application is not yet complete or production-ready.

Users will be able to:

* Register or log in to a secure account
* View a dashboard of their thoughts and friend activity
* Create, react to, and comment on thoughts
* Add and remove friends
* Navigate protected routes based on authentication
* Interact with a RESTful backend API and custom UI components
* This tool is ideal for students, developers, and project managers seeking a simple, extensible task board experience.
